        <p>One of the best bulgarian dishes, created with egs, cheese and yougurt. Very few ingedients indeed, but I promise you will like it!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>30g butter, plus extra to grease</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>125g low-fat natural yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>8 small sheets filo pastry, from a 220g pack</li>
        <li>200g vegetarian feta, crumbled</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C, fan 180°C, gas 4. Grease a 20cm round baking dish with butter. In a mixing bowl, lightly whisk together the eggs, yogurt and oil.</li>
        <li>Lay one sheet of pastry out on your work surface and drizzle over some of the egg and yogurt mixture. Scatter over some feta and then roll up the pastry from one of the short sides, into a cigar shape. Place in the prepared baking dish, following the edge. Repeat with the remaining sheets of pastry, spiralling the rolls until the dish is full. Spoon any remaining egg and yogurt mixture into any gaps in the coil and then dot the top with butter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes, or until risen and golden brown. Remove from the oven, cover with a clean cloth and leave to cool until warm. Serve cut into wedges.</li>
