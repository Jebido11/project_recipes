        <h1>Mekitsi</h1>
        <img class="images" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.thebalkanfoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_0402.jpeg?resize=796%2C1024&ssl=1" alt="bulgarian mekitsi - fried doughnuts">
        <p>These traditional Bulgarian breakfast flatbreads (Mekitsi) resemble a doughnut in taste. Often referred to as Street Mekitsi, they are extremely popular street food in Bulgaria. Some skill is required when making and frying mekitsi because the dough is very sticky and it’s difficult to shape, but it’s definitely worth trying this recipe as the flatbreads taste so good sprinkled with glazing sugar, honey, jam or feta cheese. A good mekitsa must be wonderfully crisp on the outside and soft in the middle.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <h4>Doughnuts:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 kg of white flour (type 500)</li>
            <li>200 g of yogurt</li>
            <li>100 ml of milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>8 g of dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp of sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of sunflower oil</li>
            <li>Sunflower (neutral) oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fillings:</h4>
        <p>By choice but in my house mekitsi is a dessert, filled with houney, nutella or just sprinkled with powdered sugar</p>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the yogurt and baking soda and leave for 10 min</li>
            <li>Mix the milk, dry yeast, and sugar and leave for 10 min</li>
            <li>Sift the flour</li>
            <li>Add the egg, yogurt, milk, and salt to the flour</li>
            <li>Form a soft dough</li>
            <li>Add the oil to the dough and cover it with plastic wrap</li>
            <li>Let it rise for 1-2 hours (or overnight in the fridge)</li>
            <li>Make small dough balls</li>
            <li>Press the ball and stretch it with your hands until the mekitsa is thick, about ½ cm</li>
            <li>Fry in preheated oil on medium heat (1-2 min on each side)</li>
            <li>Serve warm with yogurt, ayran (yogurt and water drink), jam, honey, maple syrup, or simply dust with powdered sugar - or for extra fun, try using the mekitsi as a wrap for a hotdog</li>
        </ol>
