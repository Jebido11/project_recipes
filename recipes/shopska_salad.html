        <p>This super quick Bulgarian Shopska Salad is one of the easiest, coolest, and tastiest three ingredient salads in the world!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>fresh tomatoes</li>
            <li>cucumbers</li>
            <li>bulgarian feta cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pop your diced tomatoes and cucumber in a serving bowl and give everything a stir until evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>Optional step: Add in any extra ingredients to suit your taste, such as red pepper, olives, olive oil, vinegar, and salt & pepper if you’re using them, then stir through again.</li>
            <li>Let it snow! Grate the cheese right over the bowl until well and truly covered.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately (or store for around 30 mins in the fridge).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For an extra cooling salad, keep your ingredients in the fridge right up until you’re ready to prep. You can even pop them in the freezer for a few minutes to cool them down even further.</p>
